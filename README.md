# RL-SAC
SAC implementation

1. Network Architectures:
- The GaussianPolicy network outputs mean and log standard deviation of a Gaussian distribution
- The QNetwork contains two Q-functions for reduced bias (double Q-learning)
- Both use simple feedforward architectures with ReLU activations

2. Core SAC Components:
- Policy Network: Implements the reparameterization trick for backpropagation through stochastic actions
- Q-Networks: Two Q-networks to reduce overestimation bias
- Target Networks: Slowly updated copies of Q-networks for stability
- Replay Buffer: Stores transitions for off-policy learning
- Temperature parameter (alpha): Controls the trade-off between exploration and exploitation

3. Key Training Steps:
- Sample actions using the reparameterization trick
- Store experiences in replay buffer
- Update Q-functions using the minimum of the two Q-values
- Update policy to maximize expected Q-value and entropy
- Soft update of target networks

4. BipedalWalker-specific Considerations:
- State space: 24-dimensional (includes hull angle, velocities, leg states, etc.)
- Action space: 4-dimensional (hip and knee joints for both legs)
- Reward structure: Encourages forward movement while penalizing energy usage
- Episode termination: Either reaching goal, falling over, or timeout

5. Hyperparameter Choices:
- Learning rates: 3e-4 (standard for Adam optimizer)
- Discount factor (gamma): 0.99
- Soft update coefficient (tau): 0.005
- Replay buffer size: 1M transitions
- Batch size: 256
- Hidden layer size: 256 units

To use this implementation:

1. First, set up your environment and dependencies:
```python
pip install gymnasium torch numpy
```

2. Copy the implementation and run the training:
```python
train_bipedal_walker()
```

3. Monitor the training progress through:
- Episode rewards during training
- Evaluation rewards every 10 episodes
- Visual inspection of the learned behavior

The key to success with SAC on BipedalWalker is:
- Proper action scaling (actions are squashed to [-1, 1])
- Sufficient exploration early in training (handled by entropy maximization)
- Stable Q-function training (using two Q-networks)
- Proper reward scaling (the temperature parameter alpha may need tuning)

Would you like me to explain any specific part in more detail?
